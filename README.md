# ORE Control

Tools for easier implementation of Opensource Risk Engine (ORE, http://www.opensourcerisk.org/)

* easy starting from Excel (OreAddin in conjunction with OreMgr),
* loading ORE data from a Database (OreDB),
* A background service (OreService, using OreMgr)
* A .NET library (OreMgr) including a SWIG wrapper to ORE and a XML Building Utility (TreeizeRelD/TreeizeRelDCsharp)

OreControl is currently under development (already usable parts are DB setup scripts [OreDB](https://github.com/rkapl123/OreControl/tree/master/OreDB) and the library [TreeizeRelD](https://github.com/rkapl123/OreControl/tree/master/OreMgr/TreeizeRelD), for details of the architecture see [https://rkapl123.github.io/OreControl](https://rkapl123.github.io/OreControl)
